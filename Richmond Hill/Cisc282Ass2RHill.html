        <div id="columnDescription">
            Richmond Hill, Ontario is the town I settled into and grew up in after I first arrived in Canada at the age of 12. I attended Baythorn Public School from grade 6 - 8 and
            graduated on to attend Thornhill Secondary School as my secondary school. My best friends now are people I met in elementary school. Although Richmond Hill isn't too lively,
            we spend our times visiting the local Cineplex to catch the latest movies and eating at the many restaurants located in the town. Like many places in Canada, the racial demographic 
            is very diverse and it's nice to be part of such a community.Richmond Hill is the place my family and I have reached many milestones while in Canada and is the place I have created 
            some of my fondest memories, this is where I would call my home.
